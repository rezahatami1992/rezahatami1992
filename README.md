### 🚀 The "Business-First" Engineer
I am an **Entry-Level Machine Learning Engineer** with a 7-year background in **Growth Strategy & Content**. I don't just build models; I build solutions that drive quantifiable business impact.

My transition to engineering is built on a simple philosophy: **Code is a tool to solve human problems.**

### ⚡ My Competitive Edge: The LLM-Integrated Workflow
I represent the new wave of developers who treat **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as a velocity multiplier, not just a chatbot.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** I move from idea to MVP significantly faster by leveraging AI for boilerplate generation and refactoring.
* **Architecture > Syntax:** My workflow allows me to focus on system design, data flow, and business logic while maintaining high code quality.
* **Continuous Evolution:** I dedicate hours daily to staying on the bleeding edge of AI trends (YOLOv8, InsightFace, Transformer architectures).
